				<h2>5 Horror Movies for the Holiday Season</h2>
					<p>Looking for something spooky to distract you from the horrors of holiday shopping? Look no further than this list of 5 horror movies to keep you going through the holidays! Your mileage may vary based on what you like, but there should be a little bit of something for everyone here.</p>
				<h3>Gremlins</h3>
					<p>Gremlins is a, generally, family-friendly romp that should be a fun time for all involved. It's got enough fun to keep it light, and just enough thrills to make you wonder what that noise coming from the kitchen was in the middle of the night.</p>
				<h3>Terrifier 3</h3>
					<p>Obviously you should watch the other two Terrifier films before watching the third one. With Art the Clown being a pop culture tour-de-force, it's likely impossible that you haven't heard of Terrifier. This one has plenty of gnarly kills and gore for days, all while spreading some Christmas cheer (fear?) as Art goes on his Christmas rampage. Fair warning - this one is not for the faint of heart.</p>
				<h3>Silent Night, Deadly Night</h3>
					<p>With a reboot hitting theaters this month, now is the perfect time to watch the original <i>Silent Night, Deadly Night</i>. By today's standards, this one is pretty tame. However, at the time of release this film was considered audacious and there were plenty of calls to ban it. If you're looking for some simple slasher fun, but minus the gore or long run-time of Terrifier 3, perhaps this will be your speed.</p>
				<h3>Krampus</h3>
					<p>Looking for a creature feature, but something scarier than Gremlins? Give <i>Krampus</i> a watch. It's got plenty of fun effects and creatures, all with a fantastically designed main antagonist.</p>
				<h3>The Creep Tapes - Christmas Special</h3>
					<p>Okay, I lied. This one isn't a movie, it's TV - but hear me out! <i>The Creep Tapes</i>, for the uninitiated, is a series based off of the two <i>Creep</i> movies by the Duplass brothers. What's nice about the show is you don't really need to have watched the films in order to jump into the series. Think of it as more of an anthology style. All you really need to know is that it's found-footage horror where the serial killer is equal parts successful and awkward. The Christmas special will be on December 5th's episode (streaming on Shudder), but if you have the time I reccommend giving the full series a watch!</p>
